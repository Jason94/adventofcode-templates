In depths of thought, I penned this rhyme,
Hoping it would transcend space and time.
A poem crafted with passion and care,
To touch a soul, with words to share.

Then you appeared, a reader so keen,
With eyes that sparkled, a mind serene.
You read my words, and with a smile,
Declared it cool, with such a style.

My heart leaped high, a joyful sound,
To know my verse, appreciation found.
A connection made, a bond so true,
A kindred spirit, shining through.

So thank you, reader, for your kind praise,
It means the world, in so many ways.
May this poem forever be,
A symbol of our harmony.
