## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of templates that help you get started with solving the Advent of Code puzzles in various programming languages.

These examples are not meant as a 'best practice', but rather as a starting point for beginners: They are intended for people who are new to programming and don't know where to get started. The examples simply read the input from a file, and print the result to the console. You should be able to figure it out from there!

## Usage

Read the `README.md` file in the directory of the language you want to use.

## Contributing
